# What is Manta?

Manta is the universal blockchain platform with on-chain privacy. We are building a scalable and composable blockchain platform with privacy guarantee from the first principle: using cryptographic constructions such as zkSNARKs to allow developers to build all kinds of blockchain applications, including DeFi, NFT, GameFi, DAO and many more with end-to-end privacy guarantees and at the same time interoperable, easy to use, high performance and auditable.

Manta offers two networks:

- [Calamari Network](https://calamari.network/): Manta's canary network. Calamari is running as a Kusama Parachain.
- [Manta Network](https://manta.network/): Manta's Polkadot parachain. Manta is looking forward to joining the Polkadot ecosystem!
